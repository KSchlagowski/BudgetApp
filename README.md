# BudgetApp
For now BudgetApp is console application that helps making home budget and monitor your money on particular funds that everyone should have. 
My target is to expand it to REST API using ASP.NET Core.
BudgetApp is constantly being developed. Branches are named after parts (weeks) of Kajetan Duszyński's ASP.NET course which I use to learn how to make .NET / web apps' fuctionalities.

Ideas how this program should work I have taken from Michał Szafrański's "Finansowy Ninja" - book on this subject.


So far I have learned by coding BudgetApp:
  + C# objectivity including abstraction,
  + Accessibility of methods and variables,
  + Basics of The Repository-Service Pattern

I want to include in the future:
  + Tests,
  + Saving budgets and funds by JSON support,
  + MVC,
  + Dependency Injection,
  + SQL support,
  + Data Annotations,
  + User support (register, login etc.),
  + Tokens
  
Progress is visible on my profile in BudgetAppBoard - Github Project.

For now only Polish version of console messages is avaible, but English one is coming soon.
